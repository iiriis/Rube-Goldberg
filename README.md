# Rube-Goldberg

As we all know that a Rube Goldberg machine which is named after Rube Goldberg who was an American cartoonist, is a chain reaction-type machine or contraption intentionally designed to perform a simple task in an indirect and overly complicated way.

So what this program does is that it prints the "hello World" but in a complex way, so that it can fit the term of Rube Goldberg. It basically opens a new terminal, makes a new directory, then makes a new *.cpp file. The java program writes a code inside that cpp file and closes it. After that the program calls the gcc compiler to compile the .cpp file. After compiling it runs the executable from c and dumps the "Hello World" output in the console. That too in a Ascii Art form.
